### Check Your Understanding
1. I will fit the automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed 
    - Because it fits the definition of automation and piping. When we complete part of the task and push the code to Github, the test can be triggered automatically.

<br />

2. No

 <br />

3. No. 
    - I think it takes more than one unit to implement "message" feature. In other words, there will be interactions between multiple units of "message" feature. Therefore, unit test is not suitable for testing the entire "message" feature.

<br />

4. Yes.
    - The maximum message length feature should be implemented within a unit. Such feature does not require the interaction of multiple units. We can use unit test to simply test the unit to implement the maximum message length feature. It's also very convenient and execute quickly.
